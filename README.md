# Microbiome Data Analysis in R
Welcome to the course! 
Here on GitHub you will find all the Demonstrations and Problem Sets I have developed for this course. Demonstrations and Problem Sets are key to exploring the concepts introduced both in class and in the textbook. These are meant to provide an opportunity to more deeply understand those concepts and put them into practice through data manipulation and analysis. Problem sets are due in a week. Each student must individually submit each solved problem set. Class time to work on them will be given and I will assist you if needed. Good luck with the course and have fun analyzing microbiome data in R!

Sincerely,

Marcos

# Additional Readings
Statistical Analysis of Microbiome Data with R. Yinglin Xia, Jun Sun & Ding-Geng Chen,	1st edition. 2018
Additional readings, if needed, are indicated in each assingment.

# Demonstrations
Each week you will have to complete a demonstration. Create a markdown file of your work. You can follow detail instructions in Xia et al. (2018). Statistical analysis of microbiome data with R.

# Problem Sets
Each week we will work on Problem Sets to help apply the course material for that week to actual data analytics. Below are the Problem Sets (1-13) for the 14 weeks of the course. Be sure to read carefully the details of each problem set and answer all the associated questions. If you have trouble accessing the data for a given problem set, email your instructor with questions or, better yet, bring your questions to the live session.
