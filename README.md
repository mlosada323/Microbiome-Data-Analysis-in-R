# Microbiome Data Analysis in R
Welcome to the course! Here on GitHub you will find all the assignments (Demonstrations, Problem Sets, additional Readings and Research Report) for the course as well as any data and/or links to software/data to be successful in the assignments. There are instructions for each assignment for each week. All assignments are due in a week. The Research Report is due on ??. These dates are also listed on the course syllabus and below. You will get the most out of the homework and the course if you work on the demonstrations, problem sets and final project BEFORE the live session each week and bring your questions to the live session. Good luck with the course and have fun analyzing microbiome data in R!

Sincerely,

Marcos

Additional Readings

For some sessions (2, 3, 4, 7 & 8) there are reading assignments that are not from the course book. These reading assignments can be found under the Readings folder as downloadable pdf files.

Problem Sets

Each week we will work on Problem Sets to help apply the course material for that week to actual data analytics. Below are the Problem Sets (1-10) for the 10 weeks of the course. Be sure to read carefully the details of each problem set and answer all the associated questions. If you have trouble accessing the data for a given problem set, email your instructor with questions or, better yet, bring your questions to the live session.
