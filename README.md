# Microbiome Data Analysis in R
Welcome to the course! 
Here on GitHub you will find all the Demonstrations and Problem Sets I have developed for this course. Demonstrations and Problem Sets are key to exploring the concepts introduced both in class and in the textbook. These are meant to provide an opportunity to more deeply understand those concepts and put them into practice through data manipulation and analysis. Problem Sets are due in a week. Class time to work on them will be given and I will assist you if needed. Email your solved problem set as a markdown file to mlosada@gwu.edu. Good luck with the course and have fun analyzing microbiome data in R!

Sincerely,

Marcos
