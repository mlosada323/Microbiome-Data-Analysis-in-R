# Microbiome Data Analysis in R
Welcome to the course! Here on GitHub you will find all the assignments (Demonstrations, Problem Sets, additional Readings and Research Report) for the course as well as any data and/or links to software/data to be successful in the assignments. There are instructions for each assignment for each week. All assignments are due in a week. The Research Report is due on ??. These dates are also listed on the course syllabus and below. You will get the most out of the homework and the course if you work on the demonstrations, problem sets and final project BEFORE the live session each week and bring your questions to the live session. Good luck with the course and have fun analyzing microbiome data in R!

Sincerely,

Professor Crandall
