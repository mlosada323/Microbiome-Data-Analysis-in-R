#### 1: set up your working directory, import the dataset hsb2demo.csv and install dplyr

#### 2: using the pipe operator, %>% or |>, select columns: id, female, prog and socst. Show with head

#### 3: now select all columns except those from prog to match (inclusive). Show with head

#### 4: filter the rows for students with both reading and math scores greater than or equal 65

#### 5a: reorder dataset by id. Show with head

#### 5b: reorder in descending order by read. Show with head

#### 6: using the pipe operator select three columns id, gender, read from tab, arrange the rows by the id and return the head of the final data frame

#### 7: create new columns using mutate() and Calculate average math and write scores. Show with head

#### 8: group by gender and create summary (mean, min and max) of math using pipe operator

#### 9: install ggplot and upload the dataset iris with data(iris). Create a scatter plot for the three species of iris with the following aesthetics: variables: Petal.Width vs Petal.Length. Smoothing method: glm. Include a title and subtitle and axis names

#### 10: use ggpubr to create a box plot of Petal.Width by Species and use different shapes for each species
