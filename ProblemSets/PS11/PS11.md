# Problem Set 11
Install packages pscl and lmtest. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function. 

#### 1: load dataset and create an Offset column using the log of the total_reads

#### 2: plot abundance of Acidobacteriota

#### 3: create a formula for mix-models below with the following specifications:
```
response variable: Acidobacteriota counts
covariates count data: wash and gender
covariates zero data: gender
Offsets only for count data
```
#### 4: assess differences in Acidobacteriota across predictors above using the ZIP model and summarize and interpret results

#### 5: assess differences in Acidobacteriota across predictors above using the ZINB model and summarize and interpret results

#### 6:assess differences in Acidobacteriota across predictors above using Zero-Hurdle Model ZHP and summarize and interpret results

#### 7:assess differences in Acidobacteriota across predictors above using Zero-Hurdle Model ZHNB and summarize and interpret results

#### 8: compare nested models using a LRT and draw conclusions from each comparison

#### 9: compare all models using the AIC and draw conclusions

#### 10: repeat question #5 but now include the formula in function zeroinfl and summarize results
