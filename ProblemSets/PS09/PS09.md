# Problem Set 9
Install packages vegan, microbiome, dplyr, zCompositions, ALDEx2, compositions. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function. 

#### 1: load ps9.RDS file and perform a rarefaction analysis to the minimum sample size in phyloseq object. Use step = 50. Plot rarefaction curves

#### 2: interpret the plot above in terms of microbial diversity of the displayed samples

#### 3: reload ps9.RDS file and using the microbiome R package:
```
a. remove ASVs whose mean value per sample is <300
b. remove samples with <70000 reads
c. covert the count data to proportions
d. perform a central log-ratio (CLR) transformation. Show results
```
#### 4: perform a Principal Component Analysis on the otu table transformed in #3 and indicate the the total variance explained by the first two principal components (PC)

#### 5: create a biplot

#### 6: create a cluster dendrogram of the same data set in #4

#### 7: perform a t-test analysis of differential abundance for factor "wash" in ALDEx2 for ps9.RDS and show results

#### 8: display the ASVs significant for expected Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.001 of Wilcoxon rank sum test

#### 9: perform a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of differential abundance for factor "region" in ALDEx2 for ps9.RDS and show results

#### 10: display the ASVs significant for expected Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.0001 of Wilcoxon rank sum test
