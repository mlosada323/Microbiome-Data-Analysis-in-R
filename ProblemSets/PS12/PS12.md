# Problem Set 12
Install packages lme4, ggplot2, emmeans and lmtest. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function. 

#### 1 load data set a have a look at the data distribution of response variables Bacteroidota and Shannon index

#### 2: Are response variables Bacteroidota and Shannon diversity affected by age (predictor)? Test that hypothesis using a linear model

#### 3: Are our data independent across labs? Check that using box plots. Interpret results

#### 4: create a lm including labs for the response variable varying significantly across ages. Interpret the result

#### 5: create a lme including random effects. Interpret the outcome

#### 6: How much variance in the data is explained by labs?

#### 7: compare the model above to another model without the fixed effect using. Interpret result  

#### 8: test other response (PD) and predictors (year_m) using LME 

#### 9: compare the model above to another model without the fixed effect using. Interpret result  

#### 10:perform pairwise comparisons across year_m and interpret the result
