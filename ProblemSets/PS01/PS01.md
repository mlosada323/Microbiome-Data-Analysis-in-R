# Problem Set 1
Complete the following problem set. Once completed use File > Compile report in R Studio to create pdf of problem set

## 1. Install R and RStudio and set your Working Directory in R to directory and a folder named "Microbiome_Analysis"


## 2: import dataset hsb2demo.csv


## 3: view dataset
View(hsb2demo)
head(hsb2demo)
print(hsb2demo)

# 4: summarize dataset
summary(hsb2demo)

# 5: Check dimensions of Microbiome Data
dim(hsb2demo)

# 6: Check total zeros in the table
sum(hsb2demo == 0)

# 6: Check how many non-zeros in the table
sum(hsb2demo != 0)

# 7: use apply to estimate mean to columns 6 to 10 
hsb2demo_sel <- (hsb2demo[,-c(1:5)])
head(hsb2demo_sel)
head(apply(hsb2demo_sel, 2, mean)) # 2 = columns

# 8: use ifelse to create two groups for read lower and higher than 50 
group <- ifelse(hsb2demo$read < 50,1,2)
group

# 9: Boxplot of writing score by gender
boxplot(write ~ female,data=hsb2demo, main="High School
Students Data", xlab="Gender", ylab="Writing score by gender")

# 10: Use File > Compile report in R Studio to create pdf of problem set 

3: save dataset hsb2demo.csv as hsb2demo_new.csv
write.csv(hsb2demo,file="hsb2demo_new.csv")
