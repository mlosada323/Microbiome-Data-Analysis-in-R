# Problem Set 3
Install packages phyloseq and microbiome. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function.

#### 1: Install phyloseq and create a ps object with the attached files. Show the phyloseq-class experiment-level object

#### 2: List the following features about the ps object: 
```r
sample names
min number of reads per sample
variable names
taxonomic ranks
summary of ps
```

#### 3: list all phyla in the ps 

#### 4: Export table of ASVs with taxonomy

#### 5: subset samples BE and BT in factor region_c. Show ps

#### 6: remove singletons. Show ps

#### 7a: remove samples with less than 5000 reads. Show ps

#### 7b: remove ASVs whose mean value per sample is less than 1. Show ps

#### 8a: estimate absolute abundances and show results

#### 8b: estimate relative abundances and show results

#### 9a: Melt phyloseq data as a data frame table and show result

#### 9b: Show top 10 most abundant taxa

#### 10: transform phyloseq absolute abundances using the central log-ratio (CLR) transformation and show results
