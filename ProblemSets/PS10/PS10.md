# Problem Set 10
Install packages DESes2 and gplots. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function. 

#### 1: load phyloseq object ps10.RDS and obtain normalized counts using the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution. Show final results

#### 2: perform a DESeq analysis to identify differentially abundant taxa across genders in object ps10.RDS

#### 3: how many ASV varied significantly?

#### 4: how many ASV varied significantly at the padj level of 0.01

#### 5: show the top five ASVs

#### 6: subset the taxa with a padj < 0.01 and strongest down-regulation

#### 7: create a histogram of p-Values and fold-change values

#### 8: create a volcano plot of fold changes

#### 9: transform counts via variance stabilizing transformation and create a PCA. Interpret plot

#### 10: using libraries below, create a heatmap of the top 20 ASVs. Interpret plot
```r
library("gplots" )
library("RColorBrewer" )
library("genefilter" )
library(SummarizedExperiment)
```
