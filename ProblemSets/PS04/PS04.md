# Proble Set 4
Install packages ggplot2, plyr, pwr and MASS. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function.

#### 1: Import dataset alpha_div.csv and create a histogram plot for each gender (two panels)

#### 2: Calculate the average Shannon diversity of each group using the R package plyr

.

#### 3: Calculate Power and Sample Size Using R Function power.t.test in the following steps:
#### 3a: calculate variance


#### 3b:Estimate S from formula 5.5 in Xia et al (2018)

#### 4: Calculate Power using R Function power.t.test for sample sizes 2-20

#### 5: generate power and sample size graphs

#### 6: How many individuals per gender do we need to to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in the Shannon diversity between the two groups with an statistical power of at least 80%?

#### 7: create a plot of the power by sample size and show the 0.80 range as a line

.

#### 8: Calculate Power Using R Function pwr.avova.test() for the Shannon index in the following steps:
#### 8a: get F statistic by fitting linear model

#### 8b: generate power and sample size graphs

#### 9a: How many individuals per gender do we need to to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in the Shannon diversity between the two groups with an statistical power of at least 80%?

#### 9b: create a plot of the power by sample size

.

#### 10: How many individuals per Treatment group do we need to detect an effect size at an statistical power of at least 80% in the TreatmentControl.csv dataset?
