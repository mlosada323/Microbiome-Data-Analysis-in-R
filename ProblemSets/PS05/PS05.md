# Problem Set 5
Install packages ggplot2, phyloseq, picante, cowplot, ggpubr, phangorn and ape. Complete the following problem set. Once completed, use File > Compile Report in R Studio to create HTML document of the problem set. Before you create the Report comment the install.package function.


#### 1: create a phyloseq (ps) object with the attached files. Then filter singletons and samples with <5000 reads. Show the phyloseq-class experiment-level object

#### 2: estimate Chao1, ACE, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and show results

#### 3: plot Chao1, ACE, Shannon and Simpson indices per region_c

#### 4: estimate Faith's phylogenetic diversity and combine with previous estimates in metadata file and show estimates

#### 5: create boxplots for the region_c variable for Chao and Shannon diversity indices above and group them in a single grid using ggplot2

#### 6: create boxplots for the region_c variable for ACE and PD diversity indices above and group them in a single grid using ggplot2 and cowplot R packages

#### 7: create boxplots of variables region_c per year_m for ACE and PD diversity listing first all the elemenst in a "theme" and using ggplot2

#### 8: Estimate beta-diversity indices Jaccard and Bray-Curtis

#### 9: Estimate a model of evolution in phangorn and ape using dataset ASV_sqs_aln.phi

#### 10: estimate a ML phylogram using the best-fit model of evolution above
